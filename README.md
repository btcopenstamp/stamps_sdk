# Bitcoin Stamps SDK Documentation

Welcome to the reference guide for building applications on Bitcoin Stamps. This
documentation aims to provides example code for interacting with the Bitcoin
Stamps APIs, wallet connections, transaction construction, and other essential
reference code.

This code is free to use without warranty and is solely intended to help
developers build applications on Bitcoin Stamps. Contributions to this codebase
reference are highly encouraged.

This is provided by stampchain.io which is the pioneering Bitcoin Stamps
website, developed by the creators of Bitcoin Stamps and SRC-20. It serves as
the primary source of API data and indexing for the Bitcoin Stamps project.

Happy Building!
